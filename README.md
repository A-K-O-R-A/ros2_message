# rosrust

## Package Summary

**rosrust** is a pure Rust implementation of a [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) client library.

## Implementation

**rosrust** is under development to implement all features of a ROS Client Library by fulfilling [ROS requirements for implementing client libraries](http://wiki.ros.org/Implementing%20Client%20Libraries) which are given in a more detailed form in the [technical overview](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Technical%20Overview).

Any features have yet to be implemented. The implementation will start by supporting minimal features. The optional feature of object representation of message types will be a priority, due to the nature of Rust.

The package will be available on [cargo](https://crates.io/) once any features have been added.

Integration with [catkin](http://www.ros.org/wiki/catkin) will be handled once a satisfying set of features has been implemented.

## License

**rosrust** is distributed under the MIT license.
